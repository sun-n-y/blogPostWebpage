      <h2>All About Typography</h2>
      <p class="headline">
        Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the reader's
        attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important information
        in a web page. You can use text-transform: uppercase; to make a whole
        body of text uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which
        you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other components
        of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
        headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is
        intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty
        inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more
        difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At
        large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings, serif fonts are
        considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where
        serif characters start and where they end.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page?
        Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make
        quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so
        it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        "This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it
        some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience
        Design, where we take special care to implement our web page in a way
        that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers.
        Differentiating our different typography components visually makes
        information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."

      <h3>a new section</h3>
      <p>
        And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a hr
        element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider) and a new heading. Isn't
        putting content together fun?
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice as well that when we entered in the H3 content, it was all
        lowercase, but now it's in a nice Title Case, where the first letter of
        each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using text-transform:
        capitalize; we can implement title cased content.
